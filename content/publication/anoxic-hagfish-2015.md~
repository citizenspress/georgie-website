abstract = "This study was undertaken to provide a comprehensive set of data relevant to disclosing the physiological effects and possible oxygen transport limitations in the Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshaw-ytscha ) during an acute temperature change. Fish were instrumented with a blood flow probe around the ventral aorta and catheters in the dorsal aorta and sinus venosus. Water temperature was progressively increased from 13°C in steps of 4°C up to 25°C. Cardiac output increased from 29 to 56 ml min 1 kg 1 between 13 and 25°C through an increase in heart rate (58 to 105 beats/min). Systemic vascular resistance was reduced, causing a stable dorsal aortic blood pressure, yet central venous blood pressure increased significantly at 25°C.  Oxygen  consumption  rate  increased  from  3.4  to  8.7 mg min 1 kg 1 during the temperature increase, although there were signs of anaerobic respiration at 25°C in the form of increased blood lactate and decreased pH. Arterial oxygen partial pressure was main- tained during the heat stress, although venous oxygen partial pressure (Pv O 2 ) and venous oxygen content were significantly reduced. Cardiac arrhythmias were prominent in three of the largest fish (4 kg) at 25°C. Given the switch to anaerobic metabolism and the observation of cardiac arrhythmias at 25°C, we propose that the cascade of venous oxygen depletion results in a threshold value for Pv O 2 of around 1 kPa. At this point, the oxygen supply to systemic and cardiac tissues is compromised, such that the oxygen-deprived and acidotic myocar- dium becomes arrhythmic, and blood perfusion through the gills and to the tissues becomes compromised."
