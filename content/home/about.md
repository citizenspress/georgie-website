# Biography


Starting in 2017, I am a Post Doctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania in Dr. Jeffrey Field's lab in the Department of Pharmacology.

My previous research was as a post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Martin Grosell’s lab at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. The research was part of the RECOVER consortium (Relationships of Effects of Cardiac Outcomes in fish for Validation of Ecological Risk). RECOVER is one of 12 research groups awarded grants to carry-out independent research following the April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill.

I am integrating morphological analysis and innovative surgical techniques to understand how cardiovascular function responds to environmental and physiological stressors across taxa. By incorporating environmental data and comparative phylogenetic techniques I seek to better understand selective pressures shaping cardiac morphology.
